# Tutorial-Report

This project is a version of a web app that can search for movies from the IMDB database. The goal of project is obviously to create the app but also to learn and understand the basic functionality and uses of React for creating web based applications. 

While I built this using this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9eMGE7QtTk) with limited knowledge, to comprehend the code a grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is likely necessary to comprehend the structure, style, and functionality of the web application. Knowledge of JSX is fairly important as it allows for embedding XML-like code within JavaScript, typically used in conjunction with the React JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Familiarity with React's component-based architecture and concepts such as state management, hooks, and lifecycle methods is essential to effectively build and manage the web app. 

Additionally, having a suitable code editor, such as Visual Studio Code or Atom, and a web browser for testing and debugging purposes will ensure a smooth development process as the individual works to recreate the code from the given GitHub repository.

To be clear some of this code is provided by the tutorial, not all of it was written by me and I certainly don't possess all the knowledge and skills listed above. but I wanted to ensure I included it to ensure that re creating and understanding the code was properly described.
